## The SCEC Broadband Platform (BBP) Docker Images

<a href="http://www.scec.org/research"><img src="https://github.com/sceccode/bbp_docker/wiki/images/bbp_docker_logo.png"></a>

## Description: 
The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP) is a software system that can generate 0-20+ Hz seismograms for historical and scenario earthquakes in California, Eastern North America, and Japan using several alternative computational methods.

This repo contains tools to create a dockerized version of the SCEC Broadband Platform. The scripts, codes, configuration files in this repo create and run a dockerized version of the BBP software that is posted in SCEC github repo: [https://github.com/sceccode/bbp]

## BBP Installation Options:
BBP was developed to support seismic simulations run on high-performance computing systems, so it is designed to compile and run on Linux-based computers. Before installing BBP from source code, they should be aware that there are other ways to get access to BBP without installing the software on your own Linux computer. Below we outline several of the options:
2. [BBP Docker Images](https://github.com/sceccode/bbp_docker) Users can run BBP in Docker on their local computers including laptops. Users can install free Docker software on most computers (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) then run an BBP Docker image in a terminal window on their computer. 
3.  [Installation Instructions for Linux Systems:](https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm/wiki) User can install BBP on Linux system. Advanced users that want to install many of the BBP simulation regions and validation events, or that want to run many simultaneous simulations. 

## Usage:
BBP Docker images contains BBP software which can be run without a significant installation process. Users install the Docker client on their Laptops, and then use the Docker client software to run BBP Docker images. Docker client software is available as a free software download for several operating systems including MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

1. Install Docker Client on User Computer and Start Docker Client
- Docker Client download from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Increase Docker configuration to 2 CPUs and 50GB memory

2. Open a terminal window on your local computer, and create a directory where you will run BBP
- mkdir /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker
- cd /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker

3. Create a "target" directory where BBP files are input/output
- cd /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker
- mkdir target
- ls /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker/target

4. Open a terminal window and start the BBP Docker image using the docker run command below. The BBP image will be downloaded from Dockerhub. The image is about 80GB so download time may be minutes or longer.
- docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,destination=/app/target  sceccode/bbp_19_8_0:211210

5. The images starts and users sees a Linux bash shell command line prompt as user "bbp" in directory: /app/target
 
7. Run a the bbp text-based interface:
- $run_bbpy.py

8. The files generated by the default validation simulation will be saved to the target directory on the users host computer. Inside the container, the BBP output files are written to /app/target

9. The files written to the /app/target directory are available after the container exits.

## Support:
Support for BBP docker images is provided by that Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Research Computing Group. This group supports several research software distributions including UCVM. Users can report issues and feature requests using UCVM's github-based issue tracking link below. Developers will also respond to emails sent to the SCEC software contact listed below.

# Overview of Building a new Docker image from the BBP
## Select Working Directory on Development Computer
On a mac start at:
/Users/maechlin

## Retrieve this repo. This repo contains bbp docker tools
git clone https://github.com/sceccode/bbp_docker.git

This creates a directory call bbp_docker. On my Mac as:
/Users/maechlin/bbp_docker

## Retrieve the desired version of the bbp platform
<pre>
Move into the bbp_docker directory on the development computer.
cd /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker

The git retrieval command for the starting branch of BBP:
$git clone --single-branch --branch 19.8.0-python3-dev https://github.com/sceccode/bbp.git
</pre>

## BBP Command Line Installation Inputs
This repo contains a file setup_inputs.txt. This is a list of inputs to the bbp install script. Currently, during the installation process, this file is redirected as standard input to the bbp installation script.

See the wiki page to see list of inputs to bbp install, and to interpret the settings in this setup_inputs.txt file.
https://github.com/pjmaechling/bbp_docker/wiki

## Stage large files in bbp_docker directory
So the install script does not wait for the network, the build script assumes
that required large files are pre-installed in the bbp_docker/ directory.
The required files include an Anaconda installationa, one regional GT velocity model, and three validation events in that region:
- Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
- chino-hills-validation-19.4.0.tar.gz
- nr-validation-19.4.0.tar.gz
- labasin500-velocity-model-19.4.0.tar.gz
- whittier-validation-19.4.0.tar.gz

## build.sh script
This script contains the "docker build" command. When this script is run, the docker file is converted to a docker image. For larger installations, the docker build process may take multiple hours.

## Usage Model for BBP Docker Installations.
The User starts docker on their computer. The docker daemon must be running. Then, the User moves to a directory on their computer where they want to run the bbp. Let's say this directory is /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker

The user will cd to this directory, and create a subdirectory call /target. As an example:
/Users/maechlin/bbp_docker/target

The bbp platform will read input files and write results to this ./target directory. File in this directory will be preserved after the Container exits or terminates.

## run_bbp.sh script
Once the bbp image has been built, it can be run with this script:
$ run_bbp.sh

This script mounts the ./target subdirectory in the container. It will pull the bbp image specified in this file from a local Docker repo, or from Dockerhub if not found locally. The images are 50GB+, so if they are downloaded from Dockerhub, it may take more than an hour to start up the container. Once the image is cached locally, the container will start up rapidly.

## Once BBP Containers starts up
The user runs the run_bbp.sh script in terminal window at the command line on their host computer. When they run this script, the command line changes in their terminal window, and the user is presented with a Linux command line prompt. The users should cd into the /app/target directory. The files from their host computer (e.g. the files in /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker/target) will found in this directory. When the users runs the bbp platform from here, the results will be written to subdirectories of /app/target.
$cd /app/target

## Interaactive BBP Command Line Interface
Users can invoke the BBP command line interface, and the bbp will ask users a series of questions about the simulation they wish to run. 
$run_bbp.py

## Run Cmd:
docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target,destination=/app/target  sceccode/bbp_docker:MMDDHHMM

This is a coding and configuration test for creating a UCVM docker image that can be run on AWS.

## .dockerignore file
There is a .dockerignore file that defines which files not to include in the image. The Dockerfile and this README.md are excluded.

## Build Docker images for Nine SCEC CVMs
The top level script is: build_all.sh which invokes docker build 1 time.

## Dockerfile
This lists the steps needed to build the container. It starts with a amazonlinux base image, add compilers and python.

It copies the ucvm git repo from the build computer into the image, and then invokes the build process. The build process runs, installs results in a directory: /app/bbp

## Mount data input output directories
On host system, user invokes docker run. Expectation is that there is a subdirectory call ./target
./target is mounted as /app/bbp_data.
Input files can be stored there.
Output results will be written there

## Potential Benefits and Limitations

Potential Benefits 

This BBP docker image requires no installation, other than the docker run command. Also, the docker images are now portable to other computers. Potentially, large BBP calculations could be distributed among multiple instances running simultaneously.

Potential Limitations

Users must be comfortable running ucvm from a command line interface. This over means they are creating output files, and extracting selected information for plotting. Users must work within limits of images and local computers. There are some size ucvm problems that won't run on their laptops, so we need to warn people what the limits are.
